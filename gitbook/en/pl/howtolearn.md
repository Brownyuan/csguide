# How to learn programming languages by myself ?
The category of languages is quite important, not in the sense that you know some fancy words about the languages, but it can guide to learn programming by yourself. You may have already seen some categories above. Here, we make several rules to guide you to learn by yourself.

* __DON'T__ use IDE when you learn a new language. __JUST DON'T__.
* Find its tool chain of the language.
  * If the language is compiled language, install its compiler, write a simplest program, produce output phrase by phrase. e.g, `C` and `C++`, install `gcc`, write a `helloworld.c`, doing preprocessing, compiling, linking with `gcc` options to have a look at each phrase outcome.
  * If the language is interpreted language, install and start its interpretor with interactive mode, write some code to see the result, e.g, `Python`.
* Understand the package management.
  * Write the simplest project with library usage in order to understand where the library is, how to install a library and remove one.
  * Write your own simplest library, e.g, `add` function, in order to understand how to create, use, and publish your own library.
* Practise with language syntax and its feature.
  * Play with the build-in types, knowing how to manipulate them.
  * How to define a customized type.
  * Play with imperative feature, knowing how to define a function, and argument passing mechanism.
  * If the language is with OO feature, play with its OO properties, eg, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.

In conclusion, you need to be a humble learner, doing a lot of practice, however, aim to think as a language designer, understanding the soul of the language.
