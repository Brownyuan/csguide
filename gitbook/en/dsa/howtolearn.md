# How to learn Data Structure and Algorithm ?

You can follow MIT courses:
* [MIT: Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)
* [MIT: Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/)
* [MIT: Advanced Data Structures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-851-advanced-data-structures-spring-2012/)

And stanford courses:
* [Stanford: Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about)
* [Stanford: Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms2+SelfPaced/about)

Whatever you choose, Doing a mount of execises is necessary. The moment that you actually master the topic is when the methodlogy is your instinct.

The serie of courses is designed with idea that,
* Firstly, introduce data structure, existed problems, explain the existed algorithm, and analyze the solution. Basically, give you the pipeline of problem solving.
* Then, introduce more data structures, problems and existed algorithm to enrich your basic knowledge of this topic.
* Once you obtain the meta blocks of problem solving, you are going to think independently to face the real problem, abstract it, define and model it, then come up with solution. Even more, analysis.
