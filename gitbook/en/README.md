# About tutoring project 

Plenty of CS students in China I have been worked with told me that they don't know how to study Programming, OS or Algorithm, they could pass the exams, however with no clearly understanding of the subjects.

We would like to create an environment to help those who need tutoring by providing
* CS Guide Book
  * Knowledge graph of current Computer Science, the relations among topics and subjects
  * Overview of each topic, the learning path including materials and suggestions 
* QA Forum (Maybe)
* Online Tutorial (Maybe)
* Homework Assistance (Maybe)
* Offline Training (Maybe)

# About CS Guide Book 

This book focuses on organizing resources of Computer Science to give the audiences the guide map and suggestions for their CS study.

In the first chapter `OVERVIEW`, we illustrate each topic in Computer Science by answering questions such as where this topic is from and why it is useful? More important, the connections among those topics are drawn with interesting and practical problems. From the second chapter, the resources of each topic are demostrated, with books, videos and suggestions. This book is under Creative Common Licence, and we do need help from the community. You will find more logistic information about this project in the last chapter `COMMUNITY`.


# Who should read this book ?

* Fresh man majoring in Computer Science
* Employee in IT field
* Self-learner being interested in Computer Science
