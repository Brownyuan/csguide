# Introduction

This project focuses on organizing resources of Computer Science. This book starts general overview of this project, explaining who the potential readers are and why we would like to create this project.
In the first chapter `OVERVIEW`, we illustrate each subject in Computer Science by answering questions such as where this subject is from and why it is useful? More important, the connections among those subjects are drawn with interesting and practical problems. From the second chapter, the resources of each subject are demostrated, with books, videos and comments. This book is under Creative Common Licence, and we do need help from the community. You will find more logistic information about this project in the last chapter `COMMUNITY`.
