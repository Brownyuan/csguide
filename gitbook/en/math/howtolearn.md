# How to learn mathematics for Computer Science ?

* You can start with [MIT: Mathematics for computer science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/) as an introduction, which covers Logic Proof, Set and Graph Theory, Couting Problems, and Probability. It may be considered as Discrete Math as well. After that, to dig deeper in each subject.
 
* If you are going to work on Machine Learning, you have to study [MIT: Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)
and [MIT: Introduction to Probability and Statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/), with the alternatives [MIT: Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/) and [Stanford: Probability and Statistics](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:OLI+ProbStat+Open_Jan2017/about)

* If you want to understand compiler and interpretor, even more, the fundamental system design thoughts, [Stanford: Automata Theory](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:ComputerScience+Automata+SelfPaced/about) is a prerequisite course.

Beside understanding the math, it is better to resolve the math problems using your programming skills, so that you can build connection between CS and math.
