# What is mathematics for Computer Science ?

Let's ask the question that which math theory resolves the problems in Computer Science ? Here are some examples, 

* When we design a programming language and its "translation" tool chain, we need theory of computation.
* When we want to work on Natural Language Processing, probability is neccessary.
* When we want to work on algorithm design, discrete math, advanced math, theory of computation are needed.
* When we want to work on machine learning, the Linear algebra is vital important.

And more than I could list here, the advanced math, fourier transform and more, they can all be applied in real world to solve problems.
