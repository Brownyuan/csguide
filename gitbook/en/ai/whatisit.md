# What is Artificial Intelligence ?

It is not an easy question to answer, since we are in the development progress of this topic.

Think about each technology revolution we as human being has experienced. At present, we can use scientific method (observe phenomenons, make assumption, design experiment, test and make conclusions) to find theory and apply the theory into real problem solving by designing and delegating machines to perform the tasks we don't bother to do. This methodology increases the efficiency and reduces the cost. And still, we have to repeat the same pattern to solve problems. Human being, as the definition of "being greedy", we would like to break the pattern to create higher order. This higher-order is to delegate all kinds of methods by which we obtain theory or methodology to machine. In order to achieve that goal, we need to enable machine to think, percept and act like us.

That is why there is an interesting opinion that once an AI problem is solved, the problem is not considered in AI field anymore.
