# How to learn Artificial Intelligence ?

Since this topic is still growing, plenty of subjects are still under research and it may cross with other subjects such as Linguistics and Neuroscience. However, for the beginners, there are two courses you should consider as mandatary.

* [MIT: Artificial Intelligence](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/) gives you the big picture of what AI is about, its boundary, the problems to be solved, different approaches we currently adopt.
* The entry level [Stanford: Machine Learning](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) course
* You may be interested in other topics as well, such as knowledge representation, logic and reasoning. Since they are all under reasearch, there are not so many video materials online. Most of them are papers and prototype projects.
* You may be interested in how we can use AI to solve problems in real world.
  * For Natural Language Processing, take the course [Stanford: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) 
  * For Image proccessing, take the course [Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk)

But, this is a __BIG BUT__. AI is a field trying to figure out the spiral model how we think, percept and act. Since as human being, we don't fully understand ourselves, the AI which is a copy of us will be a mystery to create, or maybe we can use AI to understand ourselves better. These are all open questions. So when you take the course, be careful about the belief that you have mastered it. I think no one actually understand the fundamental formula of ourselves or AI at present.
