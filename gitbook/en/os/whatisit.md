The best way to learn this topic is to review the history, and ask questions. For example,

* When is the first OS created? Before that, how does developer work on hardware ?
* When I play a video on Windows or Linux, what does the video play do for me, and OS ?
* What are in common of all operating system ? How do they work ?
* What are differences between Andriod and iOS ?
* What are differences between Windows and Unix-based OS ?
* Is there OS for IoT usage ?
* Is that possible to create my own operating system ?
