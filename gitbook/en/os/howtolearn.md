# How to learn Operating System ?

For the theory, The course [UC Berkeley: Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcyXohw1H00&list=PL--jIyXjDXf6Q4XA6q8RYnyChYzJ0K0F2) is very helpful. And if you have no problem to understand `assembly` and `C/C++` languages, you can try to [Write your own Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4&list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M). It's better to follow these two courses together. 


If you just want to build the Linux kernel, [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) is a nice choice. There is no video for this, but very comphrehensive guide.
