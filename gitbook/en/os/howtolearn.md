# How to learn Operating System ?

* For the theory, The course [UC Berkeley: Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcyXohw1H00&list=PL--jIyXjDXf6Q4XA6q8RYnyChYzJ0K0F2) is very helpful. Professor Kubi has been taught this course more than decades with rich theoretical and practical experience, and he is still working on the cutting-edge research of system architecture.

* If you have no problem with `assembly` and `C/C++` languages, you can try to [Write your own Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4&list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M).  It is a step-by-step tutorial made by [Viktor Engelmann](http://www.algorithman.de/Autor/index.php), a brilliant German guy, Who also shares other geek topics, however most of them are in German. I cannot agree with him more, bringing the theory to live.

* If you just want to build the Linux kernel, [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) is a nice choice. There is no video for this, but very comphrehensive guide. It will be a great experience you experiment this on your own.
