# What's Computer Organization about ?(~~There is no content about why I need this~~)

As it is named, it is about the organization of computer. Before any digging into tech details, you should be able to ask questions about this topic first. If this topic is too abstract, let's make an example in our daily life. For instance, Tom from France and XiaoMing from China start a conversation about family organization, which is a topic everyone can be involved. It may go like this,

`Tom`: How many persons are there in your family ?

`XiaoMing`: My parents, me, my cat wowo and dog miaomiao. So there are five.

`Tom`: Where do you live ? Do you all live together ?
XiaoMing(~~style issue~~): Not really. I am living in ShenZhen as an Engineer with my cat wowo, and my parents live in a small town in XinJiang with our dog miaomiao.

`Tom`: So are they going to move to ShenZhen and live with you one day ? 

`XiaoMing`: I hope so, however, the housing price is crazy, I cannot afford it, and if I get married and have kids, probably I need my parents to come to help with taking care of the kids. And how about you, Tom?

`Tom`: Well, I am not in hurry to get married or buy a house, even I have a boyfriend, we are together for five years. And we definitely don't want my parents to live with us. They have their own life. And we may plan to adopt a kid from Asian counties, maybe from China.

So you may ask how is it related to Computer Organization ? The point I would like to emphasize here is that in order to learn something, first we need to ask questions about it. As you can see, the family organization is different from Chinese one and French one, and why is that ? Since the culture, economics are different. It is a social phenomenon, not a formular or theory which is definitely right, so that you have to remember its validity. So is Computer Organization. Some students may just jump into the components of Computer and try to remember the functionality of each, and forget to ask why it is there and why it functions like this. And actually these are very important questions to think about.

And now let's relate the family organization to Computer Organization. We stick with the two characters `Tom` and `XiaoMing`.
 
`Tom`: How many components are there in the computer ?

`XiaoMing`: Abstractly speaking, there are IO device, CPU and Memory.

`Tom`: How do they look like, and where are they, since I haven't seen the memory or CPU in my computer, only a black case, screen, mouse, and bunch of wires.

`XiaoMing`: Don't worry, I will explain these to you in the next section. To be continue ...
