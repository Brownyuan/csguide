# What's Computer Organization about ?

As it is named, it is about the organization of computer. Before any digging into tech details, you should be able to ask questions about this topic first.

Take the family organization for instnace. We may have polygamy and monogamy, gay marriage, straight couple adopting children, hugh family with four generation together, or just alone. why is that ? Since the culture, economics, history are different. It is a social phenomenon, not a formular or theory which is definitely right, so that you have to remember its validity.

So is Computer Organization. Some students may just jump into the components of Computer and try to remember the functionality of each, and forget to ask why it is there and why it functions like this. And actually these are very important questions to think about.

And now let's relate the family organization to Computer Organization. We can ask questions just like gossiping about family. Here we have two characters `Tom` and `XiaoMing`.
 
`Tom`: How many components are there in the computer ?

`XiaoMing`: Abstractly speaking, there are IO device, CPU and Memory.

`Tom`: How do they look like, and where are they, since I haven't seen the memory or CPU in my computer, only a black case, screen, mouse, and bunch of wires.

`XiaoMing`: Don't worry, I will explain these to you in the next section. To be continue ...

And just like family structure adapt with the changes of environment variables, the Computer Organization have to be tuned along the human requirements, such as mobile booming, IoT usage, space exploration and specialized devices in industry. In case you want to be a designer or engineer to create new computer-like devices, this is the course you shoule definitely take.
